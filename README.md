BAD_QGISplugin â€“ Burned Area Detector 
BAD (Burned Area Detector) is a QGIS plugin for detecting burned areas and mapping burn severity from satellite multispectral imagery (e.g., Sentinel-2).
Developed entirely within the QGIS environment, BAD produces geospatial outputs that highlight fire-affected zones and quantify vegetation damage.
